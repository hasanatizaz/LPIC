Library
=======
A library provides functions to the programs, because of libraries programmers does not need to reinvent the wheel to write the programs.

Two type of libraries 
1)Static
Compiled into the library, always loaded at the moment the binary is started

2)Dynamic
It only loads when required or asked to load.


for graphical interface commmon libraries are gtk+ (GNOME) and qt (KDE) toolkits are very frequently used


to see what library is required for /bin/passwd command
----------------
ldd /bin/passwd
---------------- 

Libraries are typically spread in different locations, Inorder to find those libraries, we need to create a temp cache where all the dumps of these libraries are stored.

to create cache of libraries that exist in the system
--------
ldconfig
--------

Once the command is completed, go to /etc/ld.so.cache

To open that cache, since its in a binary format we will open it by using strings command so only the asci is read.
-------------------------
strings /etc/ld.so.cache
-------------------------

NOTE: At times when program reports of missing libraries or  issues related to libraries, we should execute `ldconfig` because those information are stored in /etc/ld.so.cache and is read from there, by executing `ldconfig` we update the database and at times it fixes those library issue if it exists and not present in ld.so.cache as the library information is taken from there.
